Hyperledger Grid is a project to provide a set of shared, reusable tools for
building cross-industry supply chain solutions based on distributed ledger
platforms. Its goal is to simplify the development of distributed-ledger-based
solutions for all types of supply chain scenarios.

This ecosystem of technologies, frameworks, and libraries is designed to
work with existing distributed ledger platform software and business-specific
applications, so that application developers can choose which components are
the most appropriate for their industry or market model.

Hyperledger Grid components include:

* Reference implementations of supply-chain-centric data types, including
  domain-specific data models based on existing open standards such as
  [GS1](https://www.gs1.org/standards).

* Smart-contract business logic based on industry best practices.

* Pike, a smart contract that handles organization and identity permissions
  with [Sawtooth Sabre](https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-sabre).

* SDKs that simplify development for smart contracts, such as the Rust SDK for
  Pike.

* Example smart contracts and applications that show how to combine components
  from the Hyperledger stack into a single, effective business solution. For
  instance, Grid Track and Trace is a smart contract for tracking goods as they
  move through a supply chain.

## Project status

Hyperledger Grid is currently in the
[incubation](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/HYP/Project+Lifecycle#ProjectLifecycle-incubation)
stage of the Hyperledger product lifecycle.
The [Hyperledger Grid
proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b6ES0bKUK30E2iZizy3vjVEhPn7IvsW5buDo7nFXBE0/)
was accepted in December, 2018. Please see the [Hyperledger Grid project
overview](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/grid) for more information.

## How to participate

Hyperledger Grid is an open source project on [GitHub](http://github.com).
We welcome contributors, both organizations and individuals, to help shape
project direction, contribute ideas, provide use cases, and work on specific
tools and examples. Please see the [Grid FAQ: How can I contribute to this
